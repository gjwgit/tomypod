# To My POD

An Android app to transfer data from apps on Android that do not yet
support PODs to a store on my POD so that an ecosystem of apps can
access and utilise that data.

Eventually, add issues to the different open source apps for a feature
request to support Solid PODs. Though apps like OpenTracks have as a
feature that it does not connect to the Internet so ToMyPod is a good
adjunct although so is Nextcloud which is supported
